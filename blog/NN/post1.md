# What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning which utilises alogrithms based on how the human brain works. It uses artificial neural networks to essentially learn from massive amounts of input data. The algorithm would perform a task repeatedly, making tweaks and adjustments everyime to improve the outcome. 

For example its very easy for humans to recognise and identify different animals, but how do we teach machines to do this?
