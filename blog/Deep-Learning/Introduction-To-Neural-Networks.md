# Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks form the basis of deep learning, which algorithms are inspired by the structure of the human brain. They take in data as an input, train themselves to understand the patterns in that data and then predict outputs for a new set of similar data.

A neural network consists of several neurons and three layers. The input later, the output layer and the middle hidden layer. There are generally several hidden layers between the input and output layers.
