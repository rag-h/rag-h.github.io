## What is Docker?

### What happened before containers?
Developers would usually directly install all of the required dependencies onto their laptops. Depending on the OS being used by the developers the installations process would be different. Similarly, installation of all of these dependencies may require different steps and developers could run into different problems.

### What is a container?
It is a way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configurations. The package is also portable and it can be shared around. It makes development and deployment more efficient as everything is done on one isolated environment. A container is its own isolated development environment. The users do not need to install all the dependencies onto their OS directly as it is installed on the docker image. Users would just need to download the docker image and they would be able to use the dependencies. This makes setting up the development environment much easier. 

### Where do containers live?
The live in a container repository. Many companies have their own private repositories. There is also a public repository for docker containers.
